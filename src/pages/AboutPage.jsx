        <p id="mystory">
          Software Engineer who approaches code like a challenging climbing
          route: breaking down complex problems into precise, methodical
          solutions. My background in{" "}

          and full-stack development enables me to see both technical challenges
          and user experiences from multiple angles â€“ just like mapping out a
          difficult sequence on the wall. Whether I'm architecting backend
          systems or crafting pixel-perfect interfaces, I bring the same focus,
          creativity, and analytical mindset that helps me send hard projects on
          the rock.
